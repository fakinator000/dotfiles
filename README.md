# My dotfiles...
For backup purposes of course..

Features:
+ suckless (dwm + st + xinitrc + slstatus)
+ bashrc (aliases, etc)
+ stdman
+ neovim (setup for C++ development)

# So what do I do once I clone this?
Just `cd` into it and then `./install` and enjoy your dwm the next time you `startx`...

Or if you want just one specific thing, try `./scripts/thing`...

PS: I use arch, btw
